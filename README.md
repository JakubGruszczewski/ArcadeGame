Allow me to take you on a brief tour of this exciting game.

Your main goal is to avoid any collision with incoming enemies. This GIF showcases what not do, but don't worry I am a professional crash tester.

Take a look at a one of the levels, maybe it aint much, but it's honest work.

That close encounter of the third kind and many more various levels are waiting for y'all in the game, so instead of rewatching that gameplay feel free to download it and play by yourself.
